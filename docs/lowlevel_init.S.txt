Lowlevel setup for SMDK5422 board based on EXYNOS5

lowlevel_init: performs

PS-HOLD high, Set ps_hold data driving value high, this enables the machine to stay powered on after the initial power-on condition goes away (e.g. power button).
Setup IPA power parameter (IPA - Intelligent Power Allocation)
Enable WAS, Write Assist in Low-Voltage to save power and prevent bit flip in write SRAM operations
Setup stack pointer to iRAM
Setup boot CPU to reset state
Alocate code in non secure area of memory
Setup stack and handlers for wakeup events for:
    ARM Off Top Running (AFTR): Cores is power gated;
    Low Power Audio (LPA): Cores is power gated, but the Audio-subsystem remains on;
    Sleep mode: power off all blocks, except the RealTimeClock blocks;

Setup companion PMIC board/samsung/SMDK5422/companion_pmic.c see companion_pmic.c.txt
Read the boot XOM pin to see from where we are booting
Check if u-boot is already alocated in memory then is not necessary setup sdram, if not then continue to
