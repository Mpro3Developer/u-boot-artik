This have functions to Copy U-boot from mmc to RAM
This appear to be a BL2 code

[board_init_f] performs:

Setup __atribute__ to uboot function to noreturn
Call load_uboot

[load_uboot] performs:

Read from where we are loading binaries, om_status (mmc, sdcard, usb)
Call copy_uboot_to_ram passing om_status as parameter

[copy_uboot_to_ram] performs:

Call load_uboot_image passing om_status as parameter, see smc.c.txt
Check if the return from load_uboot_image is ok, if not the binarie signature is not valid then try to load_uboot_image from second boot_dev, if signature continues fail then hang
Call coldboot Load tzsw image, see smc.c.txt
Check if the return from coldboot is ok, if not the binarie signature is not valid then try to load coldboot from second boot_dev, if signature continues fail then hang
If the coldboot secure monitor call is ok then the trustzone OS make the copy of binarie to RAM and made the jump to U-BOOT LIKE MAGIC
